## Pacumen

The name of this project is based on the name "Pac-Man" and the word "acumen." The latter term generally refers to the ability to make good judgments and quick decisions. This is often done in a particular domain. That domain, for this project, will be in the context of a Pac-Man game.

That said ...

In the initial commits of this project, you won't see a whole lot of Pac-Man at all. Rather, the basis for testing algorithms of various sorts will be put in place. These will initially be common examples, like the 8 Puzzle, which is a variant of the [15 Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

To that end, **Pacumen** will be an implementation of the [Pacman AI project](http://ai.berkeley.edu) developed at UC Berkeley. In terms of the Berkeley AI code, Pacumen is going to be a substantial change. The most notable is that Pacumen only runs under Python 3.x. Internally, there are going to be a lot of changes as well, in terms of making the code more maintainable and scalable as well as more idiomatic to Python.
